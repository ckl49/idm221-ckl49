# Ambee Coffee Co. Website Redesign

Ambee Coffee Co. is a small cafe located in central New Jersey. This is one of my all time favorite cafes, which is why I decided to redesign it. This project took place over 6 months with the goal to have high fidelity prototypes of 8 potential pages on their desktop, mobile, and tablet websites.

Role: UI Designer, solo

Timeline: 6 months

Skills: Figma, Heuristic Evaluation, Jakob Nielsenâ€™s Heuristics, User Experience, UI Design

## The Problems
- Inconsistent page elements and headers
- Does their website branding correspond with their physical storefront?
- How can we increase marketability and interest?

For our target demographic, I created a user persona to define who that person would be. Because they are a cafe, I created a type of person who leaned more towards the younger crowd who need a place to study and love caffeine. 

## Heuristic Evaluations
We went through two heuristic evaluations to first find out what we could improve, and then to retest if we succeeded in fixing the flaws we were experiencing in our design.

While I went through two iterations cycles for this design, I ultimately came up with these 8 screens. From the first version, I learned that I had to be more concise with information, and reduce the amount of information going on to reduce cognitive load. I learned the importance of negative space and spacing between elements. 

### Style Guide

### Desktop Prototypes

### Mobile Final Prototypes
My mobile designs look slightly different than the desktop designs because I wanted to practice IOS principles such as rounder, softer features and press-ability of buttons. 

### Highlights
1. **Location Overlays**

I wanted to create intuitive animations for prototyping the locations page. I realized I had to take two different approaches for different screen sizes.

*Desktop Locations Page*

I experimented with clicking the component on the left to change the information or image shown on the right.

*Mobile Locations Page*

I wanted all information to be accessible on one screen without having to scroll, so I simplified the original version and used an overlay to present the location information.

2. **Different Approach at Product Pages**

I played with buttons instead of drop down menus for customizing products. I think this adds a more playful effect to the process.

*Desktop Product Page*

Experimented with clicking component on the left to change the information or image shown on the right.

## Conclusion

### My Major Takeaways

Coming into this with no design or Figma experience at all, I have honestly learned a lot about designing with the user in mind. It is very important to use design principles to back the choices we make, even including the smallest thing like color choice or spacing between letters.
This also taught me a lot about time management and getting on my pages for the due dates. I realize how I work as a designer and creating timelines for myself was important. I think in the end, I was able to reach my design goals and create a website that correlates to their physical storefront much more.
