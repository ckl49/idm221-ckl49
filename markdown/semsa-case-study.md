Role: UI Designer, team

Timeline: Ongoing (1 month)

Skills: Wix, UI Design, Membership, Content Management System

SEMSA, standing for the Sacramento Elite Minor Soccer Academy, is a non-profit organization just starting out in California. My Dad and I picked this project up from someone who started their website. The goal is to have a complete website by the beginning to mid October 2024, so registration can begin for the Summer of 2025. 

## Understanding the Mission
To start out, we needed to understand what the demographic was. 

After this, we had weekly meetings where we discussed site mapping and what the creator of this academy, Whitney Howard envisioned for these players. We referenced other soccer academy websites and started to design. 


## Final Designs (as of October 1st)
Check out the website [here](https://wchoward25.wixsite.com/my-site-5).

As of now, since this is an ongoing project, here are some screenshots as of October 1st of our progress.
