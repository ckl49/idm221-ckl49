            Resy is a convenient app that allows people to easily make reservations without having to call the restaurant. I have found that it is very useful, but lacks an element of excitement. Renaming the app, Rezy (reservation easy), I wanted to incorporate new microinteractions, practice animation skills, and change the workflow a bit.

            <h2>Booking A Reservation</h2>
            <p>
                I chose to recreate the booking a reservation task because it is essential to the entire app's purpose. I was also most familiar with this part of the app, and I saw many opportunities to implement different microinteractions. I also did basic app research to give myself an idea of why this app was important and who I was designing for.

            <h2>Creating Wireframes and Analyzing IX</h2>
            <p>
                After the task flow, I then started to sketch and create my wireframes. <a href="https://www.figma.com/design/awUqphJlNpPBZR8eN6djmG/IDM-213-001-ckl49-Rezy?node-id=1-8050&t=U5UlHxpJDFkLiUD8-1" target="_blank"> (link to wireframes)</a> I also analyzed what microinteractions were currently in place, highlighting the triggers, feedback, modes, and rules.

                At this point, I started to create a brand guide for my brand redesign into Rezy, which I chose to use similar colors but change the fonts. I believe the design of the current app is already aesthetic and did not think it needed to be changed much. 
            </p>
            <p>As for my font choices, I picked a similar sans serif font for the bulk of the text, but chose to incorporate a more stylistic text for the logo. To me, Moret feels more fancy or lively-er than the current font.</p>

            <h2>Creating IX Flow, Microinteraction Planning</h2>
            <p>
                I started to bring my screens to low-fidelity and incorporate them into another interaction flow with the frames I created. With sketches in mind for the microinteractions I wanted to incorporate, I could then define the rules of the new animations and think through the process of prototyping them.

                I was able to incorporate all 5 of the microinteractions I wanted to implement, all within Figma's smart animation feature

                <h3>1. Card Expansion</h3>
                <p>I wanted to create a card expansion animation where it would take the image and enlarge it. Before, it was just a simple move in from the bottom animation, so this offers a different experience. ↓</p>

                <p>I wanted to create a sliding animation to show the number of guests being chosen, and exaggerated the bounce. I also learned how to implement auto layout to ensure a smooth transition between switching sections. ↓</p>

                <p>When switching between 3 consecutive frames that essentially have the same content, I wanted to exaggerate the bounce when swiping. I believe it increases interaction and interest while not taking away from the content. ↓</p>

                    In conclusion, I actually really enjoyed this project. It has been hard for me to enjoy UI design but I think the process of thinking through the prototyping, how to animate and increase the quality of the animations was interesting. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    I think it also helped that the current UI of Resy was very easy to work with and was pretty much a blank slate for whatever animations I wanted to implement.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Regarding the prep work and research, I quite enjoyed the planning process too. As my second Figma project, I think I learned a lot more about Figma's possibilities and improved a lot of my design thinking skills and practices.
